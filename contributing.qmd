So you want to add things to the wiki?

Everything is managed through github. 

Fork the repo, clone it to your machine, make your changes, commit them, and push it back to your fork. 
Then make a PR. You can delete your fork after it's merged, or you can keep it and use it for more pull requests later. 

# Guidelines for Contribution

1. **Be Respectful and Kind**: Treat all contributors with respect. Be considerate of others' viewpoints and contributions. Avoid using offensive or inappropriate language.

2. **Preserve Existing Content**: Make an effort not to remove or overwrite content that others have written. If you believe changes are necessary, discuss them with the original author or in the discussion section.

3. **Strive for Clarity and Accuracy**: Ensure that your contributions are clear, concise, and accurate. Provide references or sources for any factual information you add.

4. **Collaborate and Communicate**: Engage with other contributors through comments and discussions. Collaboration leads to better content and a more vibrant community.

5. **Follow Formatting Guidelines**: Adhere to the formatting and style guidelines of the wiki. Consistent formatting helps maintain a professional and readable appearance.

6. **Cite Your Sources**: When adding new information, always cite your sources. This helps maintain the credibility and reliability of the wiki.

7. **Review and Revise**: Regularly review and revise your contributions to ensure they remain up-to-date and accurate. Be open to feedback and willing to make improvements.

By following these guidelines, we can create a valuable and reliable resource for astrophysics research.

# How to Contribute

## Fork the GitHub Repo

Navigate to the `utcfc.github.io` [github repository](https://github.com/utcfc/utcfc.github.io){.external target="_blank"}. 
Click the "Fork" button at the top right to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account. 
You should now have a repo `yourname/utcfc.github.io`. 

Clone the Forked Repository:

Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/utcfc.github.io.git
```

replacing `yourname` with your GitHub username. 

Then, navigate to the cloned repository directory:
```bash
cd utcfc.github.io
```

Create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Where `your-branch-name` is just something descriptive to keep track of what this fork is for, i.e., `yourname-edits`


## Add yourself as an author

Your first edit should be to add yourself as an author of the wiki. 
Create a file `authors/<yourname>.yml`, containing the following 

```yaml
author:
- id: yourname
  name: Your Full Name
  email: your.name@gmail.com
  orcid: 0000-0000-0000-0000

```

There are [many](https://quarto.org/docs/journals/authors.html#author-schema){.external target="_blank"} more fields you can enter, but its not necessary. 

## Make your edits! 

Be sure to follow the [guidelines for contribution](#guidelines-for-contribution) listed above.

You will then want to push your edits to your forked repo. 
To do so, you first need to commit your changes. 
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of the changes made"
git push origin your-branch-name
```


## Submit a pull request

Okay, this is where github gets more complicated. 
Now we need to merge your version of the `cfc` repo into the live version. 

Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
Click the "Compare & pull request" button that appears after pushing your changes.
Fill out the pull request form with a title and description of your changes.
You can be brief here. 
Click "Create pull request" to submit your pull request.
