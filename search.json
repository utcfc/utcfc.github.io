It is ideal for high-resolution spectroscopy of point sources or small extended objects.\n\n\nIntegral Field Unit (IFU) Spectroscopy\nThe IFU mode provides spatially resolved spectroscopy, allowing astronomers to obtain a spectrum at each point within a 3D field of view. This is particularly useful for studying the detailed structure and kinematics of extended objects like galaxies and nebulae.\n\n\nMicro-Shutter Array (MSA) Spectroscopy\nThe MSA consists of an array of tiny shutters that can be individually opened or closed to select multiple targets within the field of view. This mode is highly efficient for observing large numbers of objects simultaneously, such as stars in a cluster or galaxies in a deep field survey.",

The site is rendered using quarto, an open-source package for rendering scientific/technical writing. Everything is written in markdown, which you may be familiar with already through Jupyter notebooks. Contributions are all managed through GitHub, a platform for version control and collaboration. If you’re new to git, you might want to check out this helpful video to get started. To make edits, you will need fork the utcfc.github.io repository and clone it to your machine. Afterwards, you can commit and push your changes back to the main repository; more details below.",

Code blocks include automatic syntax highlighting for various languages, and can even be run inline to display the output directly in the document.\nSee Quaro’s markdown basics page for more info.\n\n\nIt can be helpful to see a live preview of the page as you’re writing. We recommend installing the quarto CLI (command-line interface) for this purpose. From within the utcfc.github.io directory, the command\nquarto preview\nwill render a live preview on your local machine. Note that you don’t need to run a full render locally, as this is done automatically when new updates are pushed to the remote repository.\nIf you’re editing in VS Code, the quarto extension can do the same thing, but integrated into your editor. It also provides markdown syntax highlighting/linting, shortcuts for running code inline, and more.",
