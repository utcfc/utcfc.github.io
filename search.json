    "text": "Observing Modes\nNIRSpec offers several observing modes:\n\nFixed Slit (FS) Spectroscopy\nThis mode uses a set of fixed slits to isolate light from individual astronomical objects. It is ideal for high-resolution spectroscopy of point sources or small extended objects.\n\n\nIntegral Field Unit (IFU) Spectroscopy\nThe IFU mode provides spatially resolved spectroscopy, allowing astronomers to obtain a spectrum at each point within a 3D field of view. This is particularly useful for studying the detailed structure and kinematics of extended objects like galaxies and nebulae.\n\n\nMicro-Shutter Array (MSA) Spectroscopy\nThe MSA consists of an array of tiny shutters that can be individually opened or closed to select multiple targets within the field of view. This mode is highly efficient for observing large numbers of objects simultaneously, such as stars in a cluster or galaxies in a deep field survey.",

The site is rendered using quarto, an open-source package for rendering scientific/technical writing. Everything is written in markdown, which you may be familiar with already through Jupyter notebooks. Contributions are all managed through GitHub, a platform for version control and collaboration. If you’re new to git, you might want to check out this helpful video to get started. To make edits, you will need fork the utcfc.github.io repository and clone it to your machine. Afterwards, you can commit and push your changes back to the main repository; more details below.",

You can then request that these edits be merged into the main repository. To fork the repo, navigate to the utcfc.github.io Github repository. Click the “Fork” button at the top right to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account. You should now have a repo yourname/utcfc.github.io.\nYou’ll then want to clone your forked repository to your local machine using the command:\ngit clone https://github.com/yourname/utcfc.github.io.git\nreplacing yourname with your GitHub username.\nThen, navigate to the cloned repository directory:\ncd utcfc.github.io\nand create a new branch for your changes:\ngit checkout -b your-branch-name\nwhere your-branch-name is just something descriptive to keep track of what this fork is for, i.e., yourname-edits.",

Code blocks include syntax highlighting for various languages, and can even be run inline to display the output directly in the document.\n\n\nIt can be helpful to see a live preview of the page as you’re writing. We recommend installing the quarto CLI (command-line interface) for this purpose. From within the utcfc.github.io directory, the command\nquarto preview\nwill render a live preview on your local machine. Note that you don’t need to run a full render locally, as this is done automatically when new updates are pushed to the remote repository.\nIf you’re editing in VS Code, the quarto extension can do the same thing, but integrated into your editor. It also provides syntax highlighting, shortcuts for running code inline, and more.",
