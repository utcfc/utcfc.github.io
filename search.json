    "text": "Observing Modes\nNIRSpec offers several observing modes:\n\nFixed Slit (FS) Spectroscopy\nThis mode uses a set of fixed slits to isolate light from individual astronomical objects. It is ideal for high-resolution spectroscopy of point sources or small extended objects.\n\n\nIntegral Field Unit (IFU) Spectroscopy\nThe IFU mode provides spatially resolved spectroscopy, allowing astronomers to obtain a spectrum at each point within a 3D field of view. This is particularly useful for studying the detailed structure and kinematics of extended objects like galaxies and nebulae.\n\n\nMicro-Shutter Array (MSA) Spectroscopy\nThe MSA consists of an array of tiny shutters that can be individually opened or closed to select multiple targets within the field of view. This mode is highly efficient for observing large numbers of objects simultaneously, such as stars in a cluster or galaxies in a deep field survey.",
