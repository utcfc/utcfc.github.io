    "text": "“Little Red Dots” (LRDs) are a recently discovered population of faint, red, compact sources with broad emission lines identified in deep JWST imaging and spectroscopy. First identified in NIRCam grism data, these objects appear to be low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts (\\(z \\sim 4\\)-\\(9\\)), providing new insights into black hole growth and evolution in the early universe. Their abundance may challenge previous models of black hole seeding and growth, suggesting more efficient accretion mechanisms in the early universe."

    "text": "History\nThe term “Little red dot” was coined by Matthee et al. (2024) alongside their identification of numerous broad-line AGN in NIRCam grism data from the FRESCO and EIGER surveys. Arguably, however, the LRDs were known previously, reported by Labbé et al. (2023) as “double break” galaxies from early imaging from the CEERS survey. Similar to Lyman break galaxies, these were identified with a color-color selection to capture objects with strong Lyman breaks and Balmer breaks.\nKey observational characteristics include: - Extremely compact morphology, often indistinguishable from a point source - Red colors in the rest-frame optical (typically \\(F277W - F444W &gt; 1\\)) - Broad H\\(\\alpha\\) and/or H\\(\\beta\\) emission lines with typical FWHM of 1000-2500 km/s"

It is characterized by a composite SED shape that is blue in the rest-frame UV (e.g., with UV slope \\(\\beta \\lesssim -1\\)) but red in the rest-frame optical (\\(\\beta_{\\rm opt} \\gtrsim 0\\)). Setton et al. (2024) stacked RUBIES spectra and found that this turnover typically occurs at the Balmer limit.\n\n\n\nExample SED fits to LRDs, from Kocevski et al. (2024). These objects were selected based on their blue UV+red optical SEDs as indicated by the blue/red lines.\n\n\nThe LRDs lack many AGN signatures typically observed at lower-redshift and in more normal AGN, such as X-ray emission and mid-infrared emission from the dust torus.\n\n\n\n\nStacked SED from the X-ray to the radio, from Akins et al.

The choice of broadband filters can impact the derived \\(\\beta\\). Contamination from emission lines can also impact broadband-derived slopes at specific redshifts.\nSpectroscopy makes it easier, if SNR is sufficient. Calzetti windows to avoid emission line contribution.\nNebular continuum emission can significantly impact \\(\\beta\\) measurements in very young galaxies. This is primarily due to free-bound emission, which is quite red at UV wavelengths. If the UV light is dominated by the nebular component, the slope can appear redder than the intrinsic stellar continuum slope."

This is particularly useful for studying the detailed structure and kinematics of extended objects like galaxies and nebulae.\n\n\nMicro-Shutter Array (MSA) Spectroscopy\nThe MSA consists of an array of tiny shutters that can be individually opened or closed to select multiple targets within the field of view. This mode is highly efficient for observing large numbers of objects simultaneously, such as stars in a cluster or galaxies in a deep field survey."
